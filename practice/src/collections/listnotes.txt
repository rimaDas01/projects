ArrayList and LinkedList(asynchronized-not locked)
Performance Considerations
-----------------------------
LinkedList has different performance characteristics compared to ArrayList:

Insertions and Deletions: LinkedList is better for frequent insertions and deletions
in the middle of the list because it does not require shifting elements, as in
ArrayList.

Random Access: LinkedList has slower random access (get(int index)) compared
to ArrayList because it has to traverse the list from the beginning to reach the
desired index.

Memory Overhead: LinkedList requires more memory than ArrayList because
each node in a linked list requires extra memory to store references to the next 
and previous nodes.

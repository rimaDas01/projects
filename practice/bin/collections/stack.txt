----------
STACK (synchronized-locked)
-----------

LIFO Structure: Stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, 
where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
Inheritance: Stack is a subclass of Vector, which means it inherits 
all the features of a dynamic array but is constrained by the stack's 
LIFO nature.
